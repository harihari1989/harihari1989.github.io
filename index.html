An ardent Math lover who wants Math to love him back. I am a huge fan of Python and JavaScript. I took <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">this course</a> about Machine Learning from Coursera by Prof. Andrew N.G during the fall of 2013 and have been really hooked to Machine Learning since then. Recently, I have started a blog <a href="http://machinelearner.quora.com/">Machine Learner</a> on Quora. <a href="https://github.com/harihari1989">Here</a> is the link to my GitHub repositories. I really enjoy science fiction movies and a big fan of Tom Cruise. I am currently working as Software Engineer at Microsoft.</p>

                                    Generated and distributed random keys using a combinatorial key distribution and designed an encryption scheme called inverse reversal encryption. Implemented this project using Java. Used the Java Swing Library
                                    extensively and designed an UI Layer to handle user inputs.

                                    Implemented search algorithms like Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search and A* search to guide pacman to reach its goal in a maze like environment.  Designed heuristics for Uniform Cost Search and A* search and implemented those. Also made some tweaks to find a solution when there are multiple goal states. Implemented this project using Python.

                                    Implemented a spelling corrector app which takes in a misspelt word and attempts to correct it to a dictionary word using NodeJS.

                                    Implemented One vs All logistic regression technique to identity hand written digits. Used a high level interpreted language called Octave for implementation.  Used 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of Hand-written digits as a training set for the algorithm. Also implemented the same using a 3 layered Neural Network and saw the accuracy improve from previous 94.9% (for logistic regression) to 97.0%.
