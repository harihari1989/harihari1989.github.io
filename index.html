											<p>I graduated with Bachelors in Computer Science at Madras Insitute of Technology, Anna University. Interested in solving hard computer science problems. An ardent Math lover who wants Math to love him back. I am huge fan of Python and JavaScript. I took <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">this course</a> about Machine Learning from Coursera by Prof. Andrew N.G during the fall of 2013 and have been really hooked to Machine Learning since then. Recently, I have started a blog <a href="http://machinelearner.quora.com/">Machine Learner</a> on Quora. <a href="https://github.com/harihari1989">Here</a> is the link to my GitHub repositories. I really enjoy science fiction movies and a big fan of Tom Cruise. I am currently working as Software Engineer at Microsoft.</p>

								<div class="row">
									<h2><a href="https://github.com/harihari1989/Sentiment-Anaysis">Sentiment Analysis</a></h2>
									<div class="col-md-10">
										Sentiment Analysis of twitter live stream data using AFINN text. This is done as a part of the Introduction to Data Science Coursera Course.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<h2>Inverse Reversal Encryption</h2> 
									<div class="col-md-10">
										Generated and distributed random keys using a combinatorial key distribution and designed an encryption scheme called inverse reversal encryption. Implemented this project using Java. Used the Java Swing Library
										extensively and designed an UI Layer to handle user inputs. 								
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<h2>Search in Pacman</h2>
									<div class="col-md-10">		
										Implemented search algorithms like Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search and A* search to guide pacman to reach its goal in a maze like environment.  Designed heuristics for Uniform Cost Search and A* search and implemented those. Also made some tweaks to find a solution when there are multiple goal states. Implemented this project using Python.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<h2><a href="https://github.com/harihari1989/SpellingCorrector">Spelling Corrector</a></h2>
									<div class="col-md-10">
										Implemented a spelling corrector app which takes in a misspelt word and attempts to correct it to a dictionary word using NodeJS. Made use of the technique mentioned by Peter Norvig in this blog <a href="http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html">How to write a spelling corrector</a>.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<h2>Recognition of Hand Written Digits</h2>
									<div class="col-md-10">
										Implemented One vs All logistic regression technique to identity hand written digits. Used a high level interpreted language called Octave for implementation.  Used 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of Hand-written digits as a training set for the algorithm. Also implemented the same using a 3 layered Neural Network and saw the accuracy improve from previous 94.9% (for logistic regression) to 97.0%.

									<h1>Elemental Principles to achieve elevation in software</h1>
									<ul>
										<li>As a leader, You should not only practice the art of perfection but also perfect the art of practicing</li>
										<li>As a leader, you should be the Go To Person for problems and Go Through Person for solutions.</li>
										<li>As a senior engineer, your ideas should not be bounded by the limits of what has already been done, your ideas should be unbounded by the limitlessness of what can be possibly done.</li>
										<li>As a senior engineer, you should be humble enough to do things below you current level and hungry enough to do things beyond your current level. </li>
										<li>As a leader, you should have the confidence to explain the things you know, humility to accept the things you don't and preserverence to do what it takes to learn the things which you dont know and get confidence.</li>
										<li>Features you deliver by not thinking hard enough wonâ€™t last long enough.</li>
										<li>As a leader, you should know when to hit refresh and when to start afresh. </li>
										<li>As a leader, you should not only articulate what you ideate but also ideate what you articulate. </li>
										<li>As a leader, you should not be proud because of the fact that there are many people working behind you, the people behind you should be proud because you are working in front of them. </li>
										<li>As a leader, you should know when to be fast and furious and when to be slow and curious.</li>
										<li>As a leader, you should not only calibrate you concentration on doing the right things but also concentrate on the way you calibrate to do things right.  </li>
										<li>As a leader, you should have a super power, i.e to make others super.  </li>
										<li>In an established business, the ideas should not only be radical enough to be path breaking, but also practical enough to be non-breaking.</li>
										<li>JAR principle of level headedness (Just About Right principle): Don't overthink and overdo. Don't underthink and underdo. Think Right enough and do just enough. </li>
										<li>In a legacy system, a dev should not only look at the way the code works, but also work on the way the code looks. </li>
										<li>Ideas must be malleable enough to be marketable and ductile enough to be democratizable. </li>
										<li> Customers don't care what you do, unless you do what they care </li>
